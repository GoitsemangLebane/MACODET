		<h1>WELCOME MACODET</h1>
        <h2>1.1 Project Background</h2>
		<p> Botswana’s tourism landscape has been based on wildlife, particularly the ‘Big Five’, and concentrated in the Ngamiland and Chobe districts. This has resulted in uneven geographical distribution of tourism related infrastructure. Meanwhile, other parts of the country with limited populations and diversity of wildlife have remained unexplored, despite being well endowed with rich cultural and traditional practices. Manyana village has good potential for eco-tourism. Besides its attractive hilly landscape the village has geographical and cultural features and sites of historical importance. The potential offered by these features to eco-tourism has, however, not been exploited. Important historical features if left undeveloped could end up being destroyed or even displaced by other developments.</p>

		<h3>1.1.1 Objectives</h3>

		<p>The objectives of the study were to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>assess the potential and viability of community-based tourism focusing on cultural and historical assets in Manyana;</li>
			<li>ensure effective participation of the community of Manyana in the design and execution of the various tourism ventures;</li>
			<li>generate information on conservation threats faced by the cultural assets in Manyana, thereby creating an incentive for sustainable use of natural resources.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>1.2 Project Area Description</h2>

		<p>Manyana is in the Southern district (Moshupa sub-district) about 17 kilometres east of 
            Moshupa and approximately 50km from the District Administration at Kanye. 
            Manyana has good tar road linkages with Gaborone and the neighbouring Mankgodi 
            village. The Manyana area extends beyond the built up area of the village. Localities 
            of Manyana include Bikwe, Boswelakgosi, Thakadiawa, Fikeng, Rathogwana, 
            Makokwe, Bikwane, Dialane, Manyelanong, Ramating, Mokata, and Sekgweng.</p>

        <h3>1.2.1.1 Ecotourism</h3>
        
        <p>Ecotourism has been defined as a form of nature based tourism, with a set of 
            principles and as a specific tourism market niche. Our understanding of ecotourism 
            throughout this report is based on the IUCN definition and on the principles described 
            by the Botswana Ecotourism Strategy of 2002. According to the IUCN, and the 
            Botswana Ecotourism Strategy of 2002 ecotourism is environmentally responsible 
            travel to areas of natural and cultural heritage to sustainably utilise natural resources 
            to economically benefit the local communities and the environment in which they are 
            found, to preserve the local cultures, traditions and history, to preserve cultural 
            integrity and to increase level of awareness and tolerance on both the tourist and the 
            receiving communities. </p>

        <h3>1.2.1.2 Community Based Tourism</h3>

        <p>According to World Wildlife Fund International community based tourism is a form 
            of ecotourism where local communities have substantial control over the tourism 
            initiatives. In this approach the communities have control over tourism developments 
            and activities within their area and are often actively involved in the development and 
            management of the tourism operations and a major proportion of the benefits remain 
            in the community. 
            The main objectives of community based tourism are: 
            <ul>
                <li>To improve the economic status of the community members;</li>
                <li>Inclusion of the community in participatory decision making</li>
                <li>Provision of an alternative economy; </li>
                <li>Prefeasibility Study for Manyana Community Based Ecotourism Project June 2009 Prepared by Ecosurv Page 5</li>
                <li>Exchanging knowledge, awareness and understanding of the indigenous 
                    culture.</li>
            </ul>

            How the community is defined depends on social and institutional structures in place. 
            In this instance the Manyana community refers to the people of Manyana individually 
            and collectively, or anyone settled in Manyana and who associates himself/ herself 
            with the people and the local tribal authorities. This definition acknowledges the 
            complexity and heterogeneity of local communities and the effect that this may have 
            on the intrinsic and perceived worth of the sites by the members of the community. 
            Exploitation of cultural heritage will not only reduce over-emphasis on wildlife based 
            tourism but also diversify the economy and improve livelihoods of the local people. 
            This would create an incentive for sustainable use of natural resources by the 
            community.</p>

            <h2>1.3 Conceptual Framework</h2>
            
            <p>The conceptual framework is a logical analysis of the development constraints and the 
                options for addressing these constraints. It provides a road map that will inform 
                project planning and progress. Previous reports provided the policy framework and 
                possible options for addressing the development problem. The Prefeasibility (this 
                report) outlines recommendation to the possible and/ or proposed option for 
                community based tourism in Manyana. Figure 2 outlines key action areas and possible 
                outcomes of each stage.
